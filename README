Playing around with OpenSRF as a potential curation services architecture backplane.

osrf_test_service.py is an OpenSRF service
    based on example from OpenSRF src)
osrf_test_client.py is an app that makes a call to the OpenSRF service
    based on example from Dan Scott's excellent "Easing Gently into OpenSRF"

There's a little bug in the versioning service but otherwise these simple services are working, and micro_client connects to them and invokes them a-ok.

Take a look at output.txt to see what these services create on disk.
